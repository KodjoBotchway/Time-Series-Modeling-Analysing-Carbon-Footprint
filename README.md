ANALYSING AND FORECASTING THE CARBON FOOTPRINT IN THE UNITED STATES USING A TIME SERIES DATA MINING MODEL

`ABSTRACT`
The ever-increasing concentration of the quantity of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere continues to drive alarming environmental consequences in relation to global warming and climate change. In this study, we plan to use a forecasting model to make a prediction and time series forecast of the carbon footprint for the USA over a period. We seek to accomplish this using different sources and use the results to identify potential areas of concern. Results indicate increasing carbon emissions in the electricity/heat sector. Focusing on the reduction of the carbon emissions across all sectors, the electricity and heat sector is a great place to begin for solution evaluation.
